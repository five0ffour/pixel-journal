# Pixel Journal - What have you done for **me** lately
an app tracking personal habits in a "don't break the chain" philosophy

This app is named wryly after a self-centered phrase that I disingenuously say to my family,  "What have you done for me lately, and why haven't you done anything since?".   But the twist is that if you turn the phrase around to focus on on yourself it brings a completely different meaning into focus.  At the core of the philosophy is "pay your future self a favor and remember to recognize your past self for the sacrifice."   

Industry experts demonstrate that habits are formed in a "trigger - action - reward" cycle.  Habits may be hard or even impossible to break, but they can be rewired.   This app is about helping you make life altering changes through a series of micro-changes.  We call these nano-transactions.   One source of inspiration is Jerry Seinfeld's philosophy of "don't break the chain" and another is borrowed from a colleague of mine whose personal philosphy matches up with the phrase,  "a little, always."

The trick with this application is to borrow that age old solution of committing to change with a buddy.   What works for weight loss programs, addiction groups,  financial planning can be applied to even the smallest of changes.  Rituals and social support are keys to changing direction.

The secret sauce of of the application is a personal assistant decision engine.  Without revealing the backend algorithm, the decisions are prioritized against personal goals and habits based on the survey of successful individuals.   Nothing can guarantee future success, but there are ways to increase the odds that maximize opportunties and position you to take advantage of them as they arise.
